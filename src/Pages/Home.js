      Hello,
      <br />I am George,
      <br />
      enthuziastic web developer.
      <br />
      <br />
      Welcome to my spot on the internet.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am relatively new to the game but pushing hard daily to grow constantly.
      <br />
      <br />
      Looking forward to colaborating with a team in order to maintain and
      create projects.
